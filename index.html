        Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar AO BR (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (listen);
        pronounced [sət͡ʃin t̪eːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former
        international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is
        regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket and
        popularly known as God of Cricket by his fans. He was a right-handed
        top-order bastmen in the Indian Cricket Team. He is known for his
        batting skills, technique, vision and game reading.[4] He is the all
        time most runscorer in both ODI and Test Format with more than 18000
        runs and 15000 runs respectively in total. He also holds the record for
        receiving most Man-of-the-match awards in International Cricket with all
        forms combined. Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his
        Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the
        age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
        internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through
        his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all
        time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all
        time, behind Viv Richards. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of
        the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in
        six World Cup appearances for India. He had previously been named
        "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.
        Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting
        achievements, the Khel Ratna Award, India's highest sporting honour, in
        1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008,
        respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards. A few hours after
        the end of his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office
        announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
        civilian award. As of 2021, he is the youngest recipient to date and was
        the first sportsperson to receive the award. In 2012, Tendulkar was
        nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of
        India. He is sometimes referred to as "The God of Cricket" in India. A
        film with that name was released in 2021. In 2010, Time magazine
        included Tendulkar in its annual Time 100 list as one of the most
        influential people in the world.Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield
        Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 ICC Awards. Having
        retired from ODI cricket in 2012, he retired from all forms of cricket
        in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match. Tendulkar played
        664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs. In
        2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI compiled in
        2013 to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and
        he was the only specialist batsman of the post–World War II era, along
        with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team. In 2019 he was inducted
        into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame
